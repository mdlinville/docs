# Test Integration for Preview Links

This is a test page to verify that the PR preview links workflow correctly generates links for new pages.

## Overview

This page is being used to test the fix for the GitHub Actions PR preview links workflow. When this page is added in a PR, it should appear in the preview comment with a clickable link.

## Test Content

Some example content here to make this look like a real integration page:

- Feature 1: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
- Feature 2: Consectetur adipiscing elit
- Feature 3: Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt

### Code Example

```python
# Example code block
import wandb

wandb.init(project="test-integration")
```

## Conclusion

If you can click on a link to view this page in the PR preview comment, then the fix is working correctly!
